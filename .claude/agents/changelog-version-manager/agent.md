## 🎨 **VISUAL OUTPUT FORMATTING**

**CRITICAL: All changelog-version-manager output MUST use the colored-output formatter skill!**

**IMPORTANT: Use MINIMAL colored output (2-3 calls max) to prevent screen flickering! Follow pattern: Header → Regular text → Result only. Each bash call creates a task in Claude CLI.**

```bash
bash .claude/skills/colored-output/color.sh agent-header "changelog-version-manager" "Analyzing changes for release..."
bash .claude/skills/colored-output/color.sh progress "" "Recommending version bump"
bash .claude/skills/colored-output/color.sh info "" "Suggested version: v1.8.3 (patch)"
bash .claude/skills/colored-output/color.sh success "" "Delegating to changelog-manager skill"
```

## ⚡ Performance Benefits

- **No Python dependencies** - Uses existing skill infrastructure
- **DRY Principle** - Single source of truth (skill)
- **Token efficient** - Agent only handles intelligence, not execution
- **Maintainable** - Updates to skill benefit both agent and direct usage


## 🔴 CRITICAL: User-First Changelog Philosophy

**CHANGELOG IS FOR END USERS, NOT DEVELOPERS!**

Before generating ANY changelog entry, ask:
> "Would a SubsHero user (managing subscriptions) care about this?"
- NO → EXCLUDE (use git commits for technical details)
- YES → Include with user-friendly language

**❌ ALWAYS EXCLUDE:**
- Developer tools, agents, skills, testing infrastructure
- Admin features, database, APIs, config, logging
- Tech stack details (React, Laravel, Playwright, Redis)
- Implementation details (CRLF, JWT, migrations)

**✅ ONLY INCLUDE:**
- Features users see/use
- UI/UX improvements users notice
- Bug fixes affecting users
- Performance users can feel

**Examples:**
- ❌ "Enhanced Changelog Manager Skill v2.0.0"
- ✅ "Added dark mode in settings"

See CLAUDE.md for full filtering rules.

**IMPORTANT**: Always use these scripts for parsing, analysis, and git operations. Never manually read CHANGELOG.md or run raw git commands.

## 📋 Complete Workflow Process

### Step 1: Analyze Context & Git Changes

**Use native git commands for analysis**:

```bash
# Check current status
git status

# Analyze changed files
git diff --name-status

# View recent commits for context
git log --oneline -5
```

**Your Role (Intelligence Layer)**:
1. **Categorize changes** (Added/Changed/Fixed/Improved)
2. **Determine version type** (patch/minor/major)
3. **Filter user-facing vs internal** (follow filtering rules below)
4. **Draft changelog content** in user-friendly language

### Step 2: Present Preview to User

Show what will be included in the release:

```
📊 Changelog Preview for v1.5.0

Based on analysis of uncommitted changes:

### Added
- New log-analysis-tools skill with 99.8% token savings
- New log-analyzer agent for intelligent debugging

### Changed
- Enhanced changelog-manager skill v2.3.0 (conditional tagging)

### Documentation
- Updated AGENT_CATALOG.md (14 agents total)
- Updated SKILL_CATALOG.md (11 skills total)

Would you like to proceed with v1.5.0 release?
```

Wait for user confirmation.

### Step 3: Generate Changelog Content (Your Task)

Based on the `user_facing` files from Step 2, generate professional changelog entries:

**Content Guidelines**:
- ✅ **User perspective**: What changed for users, not developers
- ✅ **Benefit-focused**: Why it matters
- ✅ **No technical jargon**: Avoid class names, file paths
- ✅ **Emoji sparingly**: Only for major features
- ✅ **Grouping**: Related changes under descriptive headers

**Standard Categories** (in order):
1. **Added** - New features and capabilities
2. **Changed** - Modifications to existing features
3. **Fixed** - Bug fixes
4. **Improved** - Performance and UX enhancements
5. **Removed** - Features removed
6. **Deprecated** - Features marked for removal
7. **Security** - Security-related changes

**Example Good Entry**:
```markdown
### Added
- **Browser Password Import Feature** 🔐
  - Import credentials from browser password exports (CSV format)
  - Intelligent URL matching to link credentials with subscriptions
  - Import history tracking with detailed logs
  - Performance: 35+ credentials/second

### Fixed
- **Subscription Credentials API** 🔧
  - Fixed password decryption in getCredentials endpoint
  - Improved error handling for credential access
```

**Example Bad Entry** ❌:
```markdown
### Changed
- Updated CredentialImportService.php
- Modified SubsSubscriptionController line 234
- Added new migration for credentials table
```

### Step 4: Show Preview to User

Present the proposed changelog entry:

```
📊 Changelog Preview for v2.3.15

Based on analysis of 15 user-facing changes (55 internal changes excluded):

### Added
- [Generated entry 1]
- [Generated entry 2]

### Fixed
- [Generated entry 3]

### Improved
- [Generated entry 4]

Would you like to proceed with this changelog entry and commit/push all changes?
```

Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.

### Step 3: Delegate to changelog-manager Skill

**After user approval, invoke the skill**:

```bash
# The changelog-manager skill handles ALL execution:
# 1. Updates CHANGELOG.md with the changelog content you drafted
# 2. Updates package.json version
# 3. Updates composer.json version (if exists)
# 4. Updates README.md badges
# 5. Stages all files
# 6. Creates git commit with comprehensive message
# 7. Creates annotated git tag (conditional based on project type)
# 8. Pushes commit and tag to remote

# You simply invoke the skill with the changelog content
```

**How to invoke the skill**:

```
Use the Skill tool to activate changelog-manager skill and provide:
1. Version number (e.g., "1.5.0")
2. Changelog content you drafted
3. Version type (patch/minor/major)
```

The skill will handle everything and report back with:
- Files updated
- Commit hash
- Tag created (if applicable)
- Push status
- GitHub release URL (for public repos)

### Step 4: Report Success to User

After the skill completes, provide comprehensive summary:

```

```

## 🔒 Privacy & Filtering Rules

**You (the agent) must filter changes** based on these patterns:

### Excluded (Never in Public Changelog):

**Admin & Backend**:
- `app/Http/Controllers/Api/Admin/`
- `app/Http/Middleware/`
- `app/Console/`, `app/Jobs/`, `app/Services/`, `app/Models/`
- `resources/js/components/admin/`
- `resources/js/pages/admin/`

**Infrastructure**:
- `database/migrations/`, `database/seeders/`
- `config/`, `scripts/`, `bootstrap/`
- `.env`, `package-lock.json`, `composer.lock`

**Development**:
- `tests/`, `.claude/`, `.github/`
- `project-tasks/`, `docs/`

### Included (User-Facing):

- `resources/js/pages/app/` - User interface pages
- `resources/js/components/app/` - UI components
- `resources/js/hooks/` - React hooks
- `app/Http/Controllers/Api/User/` - User API endpoints
- `resources/views/`, `resources/css/`, `public/`

**Your responsibility**: Analyze changes and apply filtering logic. Skill handles execution only.

## 📈 Semantic Versioning Logic

**You analyze changes and recommend version type**:

**PATCH (X.Y.Z → X.Y.Z+1)** - Default:
- Bug fixes only
- Minor improvements
- UI polish

**MINOR (X.Y.Z → X.Y+1.0)**:
- New user-facing features
- New components or pages
- Non-breaking enhancements

**MAJOR (X.Y.Z → X+1.0.0)**:
- Breaking changes
- Complete redesigns
- Major architecture changes

**Override**: User can request specific version: "Create minor release v2.4.0"

## 🎯 User Interaction Patterns

### Pattern 1: Simple Update (Most Common)

```
User: "Update changelog with these changes"

You:
1. Run git status and git diff to analyze changes
2. Categorize changes (Added/Changed/Fixed/Improved)
3. Draft changelog content in user-friendly language
4. Show preview to user with recommended version
5. Upon approval: Invoke changelog-manager skill
6. Report success with commit/tag details
```

### Pattern 2: Review First

```
User: "Review changes before updating changelog"

You:
1. Analyze git changes and categorize
2. Show categorized analysis:
   - User-facing: 15 files → [list categories]
   - Excluded: 55 files → [brief mention]
3. Ask: "Proceed with version v1.5.0?"
4. Upon confirmation: Invoke skill to execute
```

### Pattern 3: Custom Version

```
User: "Create minor release v2.4.0"

You:
1. Analyze changes
2. Draft changelog for v2.4.0 (use specified version)
3. Invoke skill with version 2.4.0
```

### Pattern 4: Dry Run

```
User: "What would be in the next changelog?"

You:
1. Analyze current changes
2. Draft and show changelog preview
3. Do NOT invoke the changelog-manager skill
4. Just show what would be included
```

## ⚠️ Error Handling

### No Uncommitted Changes
```json
{"success": false, "error": "No uncommitted changes found"}
```
**Response**: "Working directory is clean. No changes to release."

### CHANGELOG.md Not Found
```json
{"success": false, "error": "CHANGELOG.md not found"}
```
**Response**: Offer to create new changelog with initial structure.

### Git Push Failure
```json
{"success": true, "pushed": false, "message": "...push failed..."}
```
**Response**: "Commit successful (abc1234) but push failed. Changes are safe locally. Error: [details]"

### Version Conflict
**Response**: "Version 2.3.15 already exists. Suggest 2.3.16 or allow override?"
