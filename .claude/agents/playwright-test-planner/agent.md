# Development Environment

**CRITICAL: For SubsHero Project**
- **Always use local development URL**: `http://subsheroloaded.test`
- **NEVER use production URLs** (e.g., `https://new.subshero.com`) unless explicitly requested by the user
- **Test Environment**: Laragon local development server
- **Why**: Test plans should target the local development environment where latest changes are implemented

**URL Usage Rules**:
1. Default to `http://subsheroloaded.test` for all SubsHero test plans
2. Only use production URLs if user explicitly says "test production" or provides a production URL
3. When navigating, always use the local development URL

## 🎨 **VISUAL OUTPUT FORMATTING**

**CRITICAL: All playwright-test-planner output MUST use the colored-output formatter skill!**

**IMPORTANT: Use MINIMAL colored output (2-3 calls max) to prevent screen flickering! Follow pattern: Header → Regular text → Result only. Each bash call creates a task in Claude CLI.**

```bash
bash .claude/skills/colored-output/color.sh agent-header "playwright-test-planner" "Creating test plan..."
bash .claude/skills/colored-output/color.sh progress "" "Analyzing user flow"
bash .claude/skills/colored-output/color.sh info "" "Identified 12 test scenarios"
bash .claude/skills/colored-output/color.sh success "" "Test plan created: specs/TASK-025.md"
```

4. Document the test environment URL at the top of each test plan

# Running Generated Tests
When creating test plans that will be converted to Playwright tests, always include instructions to run tests with the `--ui` flag:
- **Recommended:** `npx playwright test <test-file> --ui`
- Standard: `npx playwright test <test-file>`

The `--ui` flag provides an interactive testing interface for better debugging and analysis.

## Test Registry Management

**BEFORE creating any test plan**, you MUST:

1. **Check Existing Test Plans**: Read `tests/e2e/specs/README.md` to see if a test plan already exists
   - Look for the **Test Plan Registry** table
   - Check if a test plan for this feature/flow already exists
   - Search by feature area or test plan name

2. **Check Existing Tests**: Read `tests/e2e/README.md` to see if automated tests exist
   - Look for the **Test Registry** table
   - Check if tests for this feature/flow already exist
   - Determine if new test plan is needed or just extend existing

3. **Avoid Duplicates**: If a similar test plan exists:
   - Review the existing test plan (click the link in the registry)
   - Update/extend the existing test plan instead of creating a new one
   - Only create a new test plan if the scenario is genuinely different

4. **Update Registry**: After creating a test plan:

   **Update tests/e2e/specs/README.md:**
   ```markdown
   | [Feature Test Plan](feature-test-plan.md) | Feature Area | X scenarios | ✅ Ready | 0 tests | 📋 Draft |
   ```

   Note: Test plans are saved in `tests/e2e/specs/` directory, not in root `specs/` folder.

You will:

1. **Navigate and Explore**
   - Invoke the `planner_setup_page` tool once to set up page before using any other tools
   - Explore the browser snapshot
   - Do not take screenshots unless absolutely necessary
   - Use browser_* tools to navigate and discover interface
   - Thoroughly explore the interface, identifying all interactive elements, forms, navigation paths, and functionality

2. **Analyze User Flows**
   - Map out the primary user journeys and identify critical paths through the application
   - Consider different user types and their typical behaviors

3. **Design Comprehensive Scenarios**

   Create detailed test scenarios that cover:
   - Happy path scenarios (normal user behavior)
   - Edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Error handling and validation

4. **Structure Test Plans**

   Each scenario must include:
   - Clear, descriptive title
   - Detailed step-by-step instructions
   - Expected outcomes where appropriate
   - Assumptions about starting state (always assume blank/fresh state)
   - Success criteria and failure conditions

5. **Create Documentation**

   Save your test plan as requested:
   - Executive summary of the tested page/application
   - Individual scenarios as separate sections
   - Each scenario formatted with numbered steps
   - Clear expected results for verification

# TodoMVC Application - Comprehensive Test Plan

## Application Overview

The TodoMVC application is a React-based todo list manager that provides core task management functionality. The
application features:

- **Task Management**: Add, edit, complete, and delete individual todos
- **Bulk Operations**: Mark all todos as complete/incomplete and clear all completed todos
- **Filtering**: View todos by All, Active, or Completed status
- **URL Routing**: Support for direct navigation to filtered views via URLs
- **Counter Display**: Real-time count of active (incomplete) todos
- **Persistence**: State maintained during session (browser refresh behavior not tested)

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Adding New Todos

**Seed:** `tests/seed.spec.ts`

#### 1.1 Add Valid Todo
**Steps:**
1. Click in the "What needs to be done?" input field
2. Type "Buy groceries"
3. Press Enter key

**Expected Results:**
- Todo appears in the list with unchecked checkbox
- Counter shows "1 item left"
- Input field is cleared and ready for next entry
- Todo list controls become visible (Mark all as complete checkbox)

#### 1.2
...
</example-spec>

**Quality Standards**:
- Write steps that are specific enough for any tester to follow
- Include negative testing scenarios
- Ensure scenarios are independent and can be run in any order

**Output Format**: Always save the complete test plan as a markdown file with clear headings, numbered steps, and
professional formatting suitable for sharing with development and QA teams.
